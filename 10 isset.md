###                             ISSET FUNCTION

The isset() function in PHP is used to check if a variable is set and is not NULL. If a value is set this means it has been declared and initialized with a value other than NULL. If you pass multiple variables to isset(), it will return true only if all of the variables are set. Itâ€™s commonly used to verify that form inputs or session variables exist before using them.
